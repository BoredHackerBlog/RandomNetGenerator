RandomNetGenerator
--------------------------------------

This tool is used to generate random networks (with switches and computers only). Nmap output from profiles directory is assigned to the computers. Purpose was to generate something random that risk assessment students can analyze without having to run their own scans. (They do run their own scans later on in the semester...)
For an example screenshot, look at random_network.png
